# Problem

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**examples**

```
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15],
    target = 9,
```

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

```

```

## restate questions

Given an array of numbers return a new array that has the index of the
two numbers that add up to the target.

## Questions

1. Can we sort the list?
2. will we alway receive an array with numbers and no other type?
3. will their always be two numbers in the array that add up to the target?

## Assumptions

1. The array will always contain positive numbers
2. Their will always be two numbers in the array that add up to the target.
